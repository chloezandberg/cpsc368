    "This question seeks to describe the availability of mental health resources to employees in technology, as well as answer whether or not employees feel comfortable accessing resources, if any, provided by their employers to aid in mental health consultation and treatment. Oftentimes, regardless of the availability of a resource, if a stigma surrounds it, those with access to it tend not to use it. Our study aims to reveal if this is the case according to the data we have acquired."
