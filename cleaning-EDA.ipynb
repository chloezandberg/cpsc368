Otherwise, we have multiple responses to same question by multiple users whose ID did not change between responses (we can't even guarantee that it is the same person receiving the same user ID each question - for example, there may be different people assigned to UserID '1' accidentally). This is not specified in the documentation of data. Thus, we remove 2016 so as not to violate any independence of observations assumptions. \n",
